Hello World,

We are the Sneaky Baboons OGPC (Oregon Game Programming Challenge) team from Beaverton, OR. The theme for this years challenge was heroism. The game that we have created (Using a software called Greenfoot) is about a baboon trying to get out a monkey pound, while at the same time, saving the other baboons. While trying to escape, the baboon encounter several obstacles including traps and it needs to find the lever in each level to beat the game. Please Check out our game and have fun (It is still under Construction)!
